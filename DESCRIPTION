Description: Reads the provenance collected by the 'rdt' or
    'rdtLite' packages, or other tools providing compatible PROV JSON output
    created by the execution of a script, and provides an analysis of coding 
    anomalies based on the provenance.  The exact format of the JSON created by 
    'rdt' and 'rdtLite' is described in 
    <https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/ExtendedProvJson>.  
    More information about 'rdtLite' and associated tools is available 
    at <https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/> and Barbara Lerner, 
    Emery Boose, and Luis Perez (2018), Using Introspection to Collect 
    Provenance in R, Informatics, <doi: 10.3390/informatics5010012>.
